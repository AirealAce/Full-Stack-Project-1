## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
Being visually-impaired, the frontend portion was particularly frustrating, with:
-  the wrong parts of images being focused during splay
- images not displaying in the correct sizes
- card format being altered unpredictably with image sizes & amount of text content
